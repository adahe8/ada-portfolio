                                <ol>
                                    <li> The faerie world was not really explained â†’ terms & species that were given minimal description or no description are thrown at the reader. 
                                        The nature of interspecies politics and relations is unclear. </li>
                                    <li> For a fantasy action, the book felt very slow moving; the first 3/4 of novel are almost entirely exposition and character portraits. </li>

                                        <b>Jude and her sisters: </b> 
                                        I loved the Spiderwick chronicles, and to me the sibling relationships in this book felt like they extrapolated from that. 
                                        Taryn and Jude actually had a really interesting albeit highly unrealistic twin relationship: the two are astoundingly similar, 
                                        just had different methods. Despite all the hate Taryn gets, I only disliked her as much as I disliked Jude.

                                    <li>
                                        <b>Cardan, aka the reason I dislike this book so deeply: </b> he was shockingly petty, exploitative, spoiled, and malicious; 
                                        the sort of bully that is emotionally immature. I found his behavior disgusting. In the end, I hated him less - not because
                                        he was redeemed but because everyone else sank to unprecedented depths.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Overall, these characters are NOT morally gray, they are morally depraved. This might be okay because the fairy world is clearly 
                                        different and conducive to rearing psychopaths, but these characters DID NOT get their just dues, so it felt only like their 
                                        depravity was presented as a quality that made them compelling or cool.
